Hira,United States,8.8 Excellent,Alright stay ,"I had a great stay at this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, making my experience even more enjoyable. The cleanliness of the property was top-notch, and the facilities provided were impressive. The room size was comfortable, and the breakfast offered was delicious. The Wi-Fi connection was reliable, which was important for me. The location was convenient, close to the airport. However, I did have some trouble with getting a good night's sleep due to noise. Additionally, there weren't many shopping options nearby. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for its value for money, cleanliness, friendly staff, and excellent facilities.",April 2024,1,"May 18, 2024",Solo traveler,1 King Bed
Helena,United States,8.0 Excellent,Quick Stay for a night ,The room was very big for a solo traveller. It is generally clean until I find it a bit disturbing to have found water in the coffee cup from previous guest. Wanted a couple extra amenities and needed help for turning on the shower and the staff was super helpful. The only downside is paid parking to be almost USD60 after tax for one day.,January 2025,1,"January 29, 2025",Solo traveler,2 Double Beds
MRS,United States,8.8 Excellent,Airport Lay over,"Stayed 2 nights at this property which is very convenient for LAX. Staff extremely friendly and professional. Security present at all times and visible at the elevators and entrance. Rooms clean, with excellent water pressure and coffee making facilities in room. No fridge and A/C not working very well. Excellent premium tv channels and views of runway. Parking very expensive however recommend booking at Parking spot company next door to hotel which offer much lower rates. I would highly recommend this hotel and return again. My main complaint would be maintenance to rooms especially bathrooms and A/C.",July 2024,2,"July 30, 2024",Family with young children,2 Double Beds
David,United States,7.6 Very good,travel hotel ,"Convenient location to airport with shuttle included, friendly and helpful staff. Free baggage storage. Nice and comfortable lobby for passing time between flights. Not many choices to eat without a car and within walking distance. The room was spacious but a bit worn and needed some maintenance and remodeling, The bed was comfortable with nice pillows. No drinking water was provided in room, the bath tub was old and needed to be reglazed as it was rusted and peeling around and near the drain, water was leaking in the bathtub from the room above and could see it’s been a problem the was never fixed. The room temperature became very warm in the morning as the thermostat was inoperable and unable to adjust the air conditioner. I expected more from a Hilton hotel.",November 2023,1,"November 25, 2023",Solo traveler,1 King Bed
yenny,United States,7.6 Very good,Shuttle was rare when i was at the airport,"When we arrived at lax, we waited almost an hour in total because the 1st shuttle was full. We saw so many marriots shuttle, so if you want to get out fast, it’s an option. But then when i was leaving the hotel, there are 2 others shuttle. So i guess, i was just unlucky that i have to wait that long for the shuttle. We ate at the cafe. One of the worker there was unhelpful. I was standing at the cashier wanted to order some food, but she kept talking to her coworker as if i dont exist. If you dont want to work there, just stop working. After that i went to the other side of the cashier, the taller guy took my order. Im a tall woman. So if she didnt see me, she’s def have eyes issue. She’s Af American. Probably other people have same thing happen. Checking out and checking in was easy.",January 2025,1,"January 09, 2025",Family with young children,2 Double Hearing Accessible
CHAE,United States,10.0 Exceptional,Recommended accommodations before departure,"Advantages: Excellent condition for the price. Free airport shuttle bus, cleanliness, quieter than expected, friendly staff, good hair dryer power!! Disadvantages: The shower pressure is very weak, the shower water is lukewarm, the heater's maximum temperature is 24 degrees Celsius, so it only blows cold air, making it necessary to turn off the heater to sleep. It wasn't cold, but it was disappointing.",January 2025,1,"February 05, 2025",Couple,2 Double Beds
Barbara,United States,9.6 Exceptional,Great place for short transit,"Close to airport, close to In & Out Burger and other food places. Staff were super helpful.

Majah,United States,7.6 Very good,Not bad,"Had a night of stay at the Hilton LAX. The upside of booking this hotel is that it has free airport transfer. I wasn’t able to setup my Uber and Lyft so this was a gift. The proximity to the airport is also a plus because even if traffic gets bad, you wouldn’t miss your flight. Finally, I love that the customer service was top notch. The woman in the front desk gave me a $25 voucher for in-house restos when she found out it was my birthday. The security who helped me open my room door was also very helpful. The staff of the resto were also accommodating. The driver of the airport transfer was also helpful esp. when a guy in the shuttle wouldn’t stop hitting on me. I appreciate the staff so much. The downside of booking this hotel are: the facility needs updating. I’m used to hotel rooms where you just put the room key in a slot and then the lights would turn on. At Hilton LAX, you manually have to turn on each lamp and AC. There’s also no mini fridge, water kettle, snacks, free water, tooth brushes and toothpaste. I thought those where usually available at these kinds of hotel but they weren’t. The water, I’m glad I took up the offer of the security who helped me. There’s coffee maker in the room but it was wet and had drips of coffee underneath it. There was also a piece of food wrapper on the side of my bed. Cleanliness is mid. Overall, love the staff and the location of the hotel but the room itself and amenities, not very 5-star.",September 2024,1,"September 28, 2024",Solo traveler,1 King Superior Accessible Bathtub
takai0764,United States,9.6 Exceptional,Wonderful hotel,"I booked on the same day for just under $200. The shuttle bus to the airport runs every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day, which was a deciding factor. The pickup point is in front of Terminal 3. The hotel was excellent, as expected from Hilton. The children were thrilled to enjoy the pool for about two hours at night. It was heated, and there was a mini hot spring pool, which was comfortable. There was no mineral water service or water filling station. I had a bit of trouble because the bathtub stopper wouldn't close. For Los Angeles, it was a good value for money.",August 2024,1,"August 25, 2024",Family with young children,2 Double Beds
Oh,United States,9.6 Exceptional,I don't have a toothbrush.,"Don't assume that all amenities are usually provided! I was surprised that there was no toothbrush set.. The front desk staff were kind, and the free shuttle was great. The driver also helped carry all my luggage. There is a pool that has a capacity of four people, and the water was lukewarm, so it was comfortable to use even in the morning. The room was cozy and very pretty in many ways, and what I really liked was that there was a bathtub. There was also good soap, which was awesome!",June 2024,1,"June 23, 2024",Solo traveler,2 Double Beds
haruka,United States,10.0 Exceptional,The shuttle bus between LAX is convenient.,I stayed overnight for an early morning flight the next day. The shuttle bus departs frequently from the front of the hotel. It was nice to have good timing without having to wait. I heard the microwave is located in the shared space on the first floor. The facility was clean and the staff were friendly.,October 2024,1,"October 23, 2024",Solo traveler,2 Double Hearing Accessible

승아,United States,10.0 Exceptional,Good proximity to the airport and free shuttle to the airport.,"I had to get a PCR test before departing for Korea, so I made a reservation here. There was a free shuttle bus, making it easy to go for the test, and there was a separate area with computers available for printing, so I was able to print the test results as well. The free shuttle operates 24 hours, and the rooms are spacious and clean, so I was completely satisfied.",January 2022,1,"January 21, 2022",Family with teens,2 Double Hearing Accessible

Takuya,United States,8.4 Excellent,Conveniently located close to LAX,"Overnight stay before my outbound flight from LAX. The most I liked during stay was swimming pool as I was able to relax and ease mastle fatigue. I planned to park a rental car overnight but divided to return prior night as both valet and self parking was extremely pricy USD55-65 per night. Since thry provide free airport shuttle, I can return the car at the airport and back to hotel without extra cost. The 24hrs convenience store in the hotel was a good option to me though they mishandled my credit card making me to file a investigation with credit card company afterwards.",November 2024,1,"December 07, 2024",Business traveler,2 Double Beds

Alexander,United States,9.6 Exceptional,Nice stay and very good for families ,"2 Adults with 2 kids (5 and 3 years old) This hotel is very good for families. We arrived late at LAX. We used the hotel shuttle to the hotel, it was only a 10mins ride. The hotel is big, still modern and the double queen room was enough for us. Breakfast was nice. All the staff was very kind and helpful. Best thing when you travel with kids. The outdoor pool and hot tub are heated. Our kids have been in the pool the whole morning until we got our rental car to start our road trip. I can definitely recommend this hotel. In comparison to the other hotels in the region it has a good price. If you are from Europe, don’t compare US prices for hotels with prices in Europe. It’s just more expensive in the US.",October 2024,1,"October 16, 2024",Family with young children,2 Double Beds

Jamie,United States,8.8 Excellent,Good for layover stay,"I stay one night here. I got a room on third floor with a very cool big yard and accessible back door. Room wise, nothing special, water pressure was so bad that i can’t really have a proper shower. I realised most of the hotel here don’t provide room slippers and no hot water facility in the room too. What i love is frequent free airport shuttle bus to/from the hotel. The bus drivers are so kind that they would help everyone with the luggage on and off the bus. However, do remember to plan in advance if you need to catch the morning flight because traffic near the airport is terrible. Shuttle bus will go from terminal 1 to terminal 7 and if you are departing from terminal 7 you need to give some extra time for the traffic. Overall, pleasant one night stay for me.",October 2024,1,"October 10, 2024",Business traveler,2 Double Beds

Jo,United States,8.0 Excellent,Good Stay,We had a good stay - Hotel itself seemed very up market on entry but rooms let it down a bit.
